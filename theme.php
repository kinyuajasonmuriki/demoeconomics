              <p>From shortcomings and limitations of currently used techniques of demographic data collection, analysis and information extraction,
								This Platform was uniquely developed to integrate and make use of GIS to collect, store, analyse and extract information from the data.
								The system reduces redundancy and amount of information required from members of study population by cllecting only data that can't be obtained from somewhere else.
								The location data is automatically captured by the system.
